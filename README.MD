# CI/CD Play
This is a play space for me to be able play with building a full devops pipeline from the ground up. At present I've implemented the following:

* [x] Terraform IaC
* [x] Kubernetes cluster on Linode
* [x] Pods distributed with load balancing service
* [x] GitHub actions workflows to containerise and push new images to docker
* [ ] Python Test Cases
* [ ] Separate container within each pod communicates with main container
* [ ] Centralised DB service pod/volume
* [ ] Promethius logging

Most of the work that I've done in this repo hasn't been pushed to github, and thus this repo alone is not representative of my CI/CD capabilities
